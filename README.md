# 2023.05.09-Fishy-Circle
Mr. Ray is teaching the fish in Nemo's class a new game. All the fish (n of them in total) sit around a sea shell, while Mr. Ray walks around the circle. After every m fish he passes, he will tell the next one to leave the circle. The last fish to be selected is the winner. For example, with n = 5 and m = 2, Nemo observes that the Fish are removed in the current order:

Fish originally at position 2
Fish originally at position 0
Fish originally at position 4
Fish originally at position 1

Leaving the fish originally at position 3 as the winner. Nemo is really competitive and would like to know at which position, k, he should sit at.
